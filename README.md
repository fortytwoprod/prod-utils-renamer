[https://linktr.ee/fortytwoprod](https://linktr.ee/fortytwoprod)

This program tidies up the names of Ableton stem files. It removes prefixes and numbers from file names in a folder and all its subfolders. Just set the `folder_path` and `prefix` variables to get started.

## Setup tutorial

1. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), the programming language used for this tool.
2. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which provides an interface to run this program.
3. Download the code by clicking the green "Code" button on this page and selecting "Download ZIP".
4. Decompress the ZIP file as a folder.
5. Open Visual Studio Code, click "File" in the menu bar, select "Open Folder...", select the folder and click "Open".
6. In Visual Studio Code, open the file "renamer_ableton.ipynb".

To run the code, follow these steps:

1. Set the `folder_path` variable to the path of the folder containing your Ableton stem files.
2. Set the `prefix` variable to the prefix you want to remove from the file names.
3. Click "Run All". If the "Select kernel" dialogue box shows at the top of the window, click on the first option.
