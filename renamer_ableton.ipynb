    "This program helps you clean up the names of your Ableton stem files by removing prefixes and numbers from the file names in a folder and all its subfolders. Follow these simple steps to get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set the `folder_path` variable to the path of the folder containing your Ableton stem files.\n",
    "    - **On macOS**: Right-click on the folder and select \"Get Info\". Under the \"General\" section, highlight the text to the right of \"Where\" and press Command+C to copy the path. In this notebook, find the line that says `folder_path =` and replace the existing path with the one you copied. Make sure to add a `/` at the end and type the folder name afterwards.\n",
    "    - **On Windows**: Right-click on the folder and select \"Properties\". Under the \"General\" tab, highlight the text to the right of \"Location\" and press Ctrl+C to copy the path. In this notebook, find the line that says `folder_path =` and replace the existing path with the one you copied. Make sure to add a `\\` at the end and type the folder name afterwards.\n",
    "2. Set the `prefix` variable to the prefix you want to remove from the file names.\n",
    "3. Click \"Run All\" to execute the notebook.\n",
    "    1. If a \"Select kernel\" dialog box appears at the top of the window, click on the first option.\n",
    "    2. If a pop-up asks to install an ipykernel, select \"Install\"."
